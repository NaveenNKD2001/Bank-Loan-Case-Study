You are required to provide a detailed report for the below data record mentioning the answer to the questions that follows:

Present the overall approach of the analysis. Mention the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly

1.Indentify the missing data and use appropriate method to deal with it. (Remove columns/or replace it with an appropriate value)
Hint: Note that in EDA, since it is not necessary to replace the missing value, but if you have to replace the missing value, what should be the approach. 
Clearly mention the approach.

2.Identify if there are outliers in the dataset. Also, mention why do you think it is an outlier. 
Again, remember that for this exercise, it is not necessary to remove any data points.

3.Identify if there is data imbalance in the data. Find the ratio of data imbalance.
Hint: Since there are a lot of columns, you can run your analysis in loops for the appropriate columns and find the insights.

4.Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.

5.Find the top 10 correlation for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable). 
Note that you have to find the top correlation by segmenting the data frame w.r.t to the target variable and then 
find the top correlation for each of the segmented data and find if any insight is there. Say, there are 5+1(target) variables in a dataset: 
Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Target. And if you have to find top 3 correlation, it can be: Var1 & Var2, Var2 & Var3, Var1 & Var3. 
Target variable will not feature in this correlation as it is a categorical variable and not a continuous variable which is increasing or decreasing.

6.Include visualizations and summarize the most important results in the presentation. You are free to choose the graphs which explain the 
numerical/categorical variables. Insights should explain why the variable is important for differentiating the clients with payment difficulties 
with all other cases.
